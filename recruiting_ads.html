<h2>Ph.D. Students</h2>
<p>I am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong research interests in security, machine learning, embedded system, computer architecture, and Internet of Things (IoT). If you are interested in researching any of these topic with me: </p>
<p><b>First</b>, please apply for the Ph.D. program of ECE department at Northeastern. </p>
<p><b>Second</b>, please mention my name as your preferred advisor, so your application materials can be easily found. </p>
<p>Note that you are very welcome to reach out via email, but please 

make sure that you have read <b>at least</b> one of my recent paper(s) before doing so, and let me know if any of them is of interest to you? And Why? in your emails.
</p>
<h2>Postdocs</h2>
<p>We have postdoc openings. If you are interested in joining my research, please email your CV and 1-2 representative papers.</p>
<h2>MS Students at NEU</h2>
<p>If you are interested in doing research with me, there are two good ways: (1) take my class <b>or</b> (2) read 1-2 of my recent papers and share your thoughts.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate at NEU</h2>
<p>If you are interested in my research or learning more about hardware security, a good way is to take my class first.</p>
