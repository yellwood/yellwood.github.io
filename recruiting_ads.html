<h2>Ph.D. Students</h2>
<p>I am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong research interests in security, machine learning, embedded system, computer architecture, and Internet of Things (IoT). </p>
<p>If you are interested in working with me: <b>First</b>, please apply the Ph.D program of ECE department at Northeastern. <b>Second</b>, please mention my name as your preferred advisor, so your application materials can be easily found. </p>
<p>You are welcome to reach out via email, but please <b>DO NOT</b> do so <b>before</b> submitting your application. Please make sure that you have read one (or more) of my recent paper(s), and let me know if any of them is of interest to you? And Why? in your email.</p>
<h2>Postdocs</h2>
<p>We have postdoc openings. If you are interested in my research, please email me your CV, representative papers, and research statement (if any).</p>
<h2>MS Students at NEU</h2>
<p>If you are interested in doing research with me, there are two good ways: (1) take my class first; or (2) read my recent papers and share your thoughts. </p>
<h2>Undergrads at NEU</h2>
