<p>Due to the high volume of emails, I may not respond to generic inquiries that lack specific details or could be sent to any professor.</p>
<p>However, I am <b> willing to reply if (1)</b> I find your background particularly relevant; <b>and (2)</b> You follow the instructions below.</p>
</div></div>
<h2>Ph.D. Students</h2>
<p>I am always on the lookout for motivated Ph.D. students with strong research interests in security, machine learning, computer architecture, high-efficiency computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). If you’re interested in exploring these fields with me, please:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>First</b>, apply to Ph.D. program in the ECE department (<b>Computer Engineering or CE</b>). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Second</b>, mention my name as your as your preferred advisor in your application materials (e.g., in your statement of purpose) for easy identification. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to email me, but please ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step-1</b>,  Your subject line reads <tt>Prospective PhD student of Semester/Year</tt> (e.g., Fall/25), as this will help prevent your email from being marked as spam.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Step-2</b>, Share insights from at least one of my recent papers, noting which paper(s) interest you and why. <b>Again, I may not respond to generic applications without such details</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Postdocs</h2>
<p>We have postdoctoral openings available. If you’re interested in joining my research, please send your CV along with 1-2 of your representative papers.</p>
<h2>MS Students at NEU</h2>
<p>If you’d like to conduct research with me, a good approach is to (1) take my class or (2) read a couple of my recent papers and share your insights.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate at NEU</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in working with me, a great first step is to enroll in my course or review my recent papers and discuss your findings with me.</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blocktitle">Note 2:</div>
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>After reading and following the above instructions, please submit your application materials through this <a href="https://forms.gle/TKXoV5c7Jz3JF8pj6"><b>link</b></a> with your application materials. </p>
